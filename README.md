First unzip the file. Open with vs code or another ide (I'm gonna tell for vs code but you can build up with another ide).Open terminal with bash and write this code =>"cd (copy the path of project)" press enter after that
write that codes below 
npm init -y 
npm install 
In final step you write each one that codes node index.js or nodemon index.js (I think nodemon is better) and write your browser that localhost:3000 and start project. 
That's all
